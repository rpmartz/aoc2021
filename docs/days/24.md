## Day 24

### Problem

This problem requires you to re-implement the arithmetic logic unit on the submarine in order to do a series of
operations to validate the submarine's model number. The model number is a 14 digit number where each digit is used as
one of the `inp` instructions.

The registers all start as 0 and the submarine model number cannot contain any zeros, so every input will be between 1
and 9 inclusive.

### Notes

#### First Approach

* First guess was to write a transpiler to take the ALU instructions and produce valid code for Python. So `add z w`
  would become `z = z + w`. From there, knowing that every register started with an initial value of zero, I started to
  hand optimize the values and collapse the instructions. I ran into trouble being able to reason about some of the
  input instructions involving modulus.

#### Other Approaches

* Roman Elizarov's Kotlin code
* Anthony Sottile's constraint solver

### Follow on

* How would you programatically do what I was doing with the hand-optimized approach? Is this what an optimizing
  compiler does? Would this approach be more viable in a language like Java that has more optimizations?
